# Open Food Forest Project

## Contributing

The Open Food Forest follows this variation of the [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) model: 

- [Fork this repository and create a clone on your local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
- Make sure you have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed 
- In the root folder of your cloned repository, enter `npm install` to install dependencies
- Enter `DEBUG=* node index.js` to run the project with debug logging turned on
- Make changes to your local clone to fix bugs/add functionality. You can go to https://localhost:4000 to test the server if it is running.
- Use [`git branch`, `git status`, `git add` and `git commit` to add your code changes to a new branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
- `git push origin HEAD` the changes to push them back to GitHub.
- [Open a PR](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) against the `openfoodforest/openfoodforest` master branch. 

If/when your patch [is approved](https://www.cameronherold.com/time-management/prefect-is-the-enemy-of-done), it will be merged into the master branch and be part of the official project. 

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰
